TODO list:

- Server side code:

1. Create a certain number of listenning threads/processes in advance for better performance. Currently only the main thread stays in listen mode and
   after establishing a connection with a client invokes a new thread to handle that connection.

- Client side code:

1. Using threading.Timer, schedule an event that will frequently check if the server is still alive.
